{"prompt":"What is Atlantis?","chosen":[{"from":"human","value":"What is Atlantis?"},{"from":"gpt","value":"Atlantis is a legendary island first mentioned by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his dialogues \"Timaeus\" and \"Critias.\" According to Plato, Atlantis was a powerful and advanced kingdom that existed about 9,000 years before his own time, which would place its existence roughly 11,000 years ago if taken literally. He described it as being located beyond the \"Pillars of Hercules,\" which is generally thought to mean beyond the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\nPlato's Atlantis was a large island with a complex society, featuring a magnificent capital city and concentric rings of water and land. Its people were described as noble and powerful but eventually became morally corrupt. According to the story, their hubris angered the gods, and as a result, Atlantis was swallowed by the sea in a single day and night of misfortune.\n\nThe tale of Atlantis has fascinated people for centuries, with some considering it a myth, a possible reference to a real ancient civilization, or an allegory that Plato created to illustrate his philosophical ideas. Many theories have been proposed about the possible location of Atlantis or the historical basis for the story, ranging from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean and even to other regions like Antarctica. However, no definitive archaeological evidence has been found to confirm the existence of Atlantis, and most scholars regard it as a myth created by Plato for pedagogical purposes, rather than a true historical account."}],"chosen_model":"GPT4-Turbo","rejected":[{"from":"human","value":"What is Atlantis?"},{"from":"gpt","value":"Atlantis is an legendary island nation said to have existed in the Atlantic Ocean and to have been lost in a cataclysmic event around 9600 BC.

There are companies that specialize in this service.\n\n3. **Raking**:\n   - Ashes are poured out and then raked into the soil, often in a garden or other meaningful spot on private property (with permission).\n   \n4. **Trenching**:\n   - A small trench is dug in a meaningful location, ashes are placed inside, and then the trench is covered back up.\n\n5. **Tree Planting**:\n   - Mixing the ashes with soil when planting a new tree or in a garden can be a way to create a living memorial.\n\n6. **Scattering in Nature**:\n   - Choosing a favorite hiking trail, park, or natural area can be a fitting place to spread ashes. Always check local regulations first.\n\n7. **Scattering Gardens**:\n   - Some cemeteries have scattering gardens specifically designed for this purpose.\n\n8. **Green Burial Grounds**:\n   - Green or natural burial grounds often allow the scattering of ashes in a natural setting with minimal environmental impact.\n\n9. **Sending into Space**:\n   - There are even services that will send a small portion of ashes into space for a celestial memorial.\n\n10. **Fireworks**:\n    - Ashes can be placed into fireworks and set off in a celebration of life ceremony.

If not, you can clean it while it's still attached to the shower arm.\n\n3. **Vinegar Soak:**\n   - Fill the plastic bag with enough white vinegar to fully submerge the showerhead nozzles.\n   - Place the bag over the showerhead and secure it with the rubber band, twist tie, or zip tie. Ensure the nozzles are immersed in the vinegar.\n   - Let the showerhead soak in the vinegar for at least 30 minutes to an hour.
