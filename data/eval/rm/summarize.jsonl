Months go by, I see him Friday night and he is very poliet and nice and after we started drinking he started pouring his heart out to me. The next day he calls me twice in the morning and I missed the calls, try to call him back. Doesnt answer, wait a few days, send him a long message, and it said he read it, and has still said nothing.

{"prompt":[{"from":"human","value":"SUBREDDIT: r\/relationships\nTITLE: Are some people just incapable of love?\nPOST: My SO (21) and I (20) have been together for over a year and 6 months. The one thing that really interests me is how difficult he finds it to say I love you, to anyone really. He was bullied a lot as a kid and conditioned himself to stop feeling so the bullies couldn't hurt him.\n\n'Love' hasn't been an issue between us at all because I accept that it's hard for him to say it and when I say it myself, I don't expect him to say it in return.\n\nA year ago he did tell me he loved me and I was shocked but after a while he stopped saying it. I was worried that he stopped having feelings for me, so last night I asked him if he did love me because I've been confused about what his feelings are towards me. He shrugged and told me that he doesn't know what love is and doesn't know if he's feeling it. I then asked why he said it to me earlier in our relationship and he said that he thought that I wanted him to say it. I told him he was crazy for thinking that and that I didn't care if he couldn't say it. But he says he feels guilty that he can't say it because then he feels like everything is one sided (which it isn't).\n\nI thought about us today and realised that although he can't say it, he's shown it. During some off our worst fights (in cases where most guys would up and leave) he couldn't bare to leave me (even though he thought about it) and he was there for me when I was at my worst (he's always tolerant) he'll always want cuddles, be happy to drive me when I need him to (he hates driving), buy me flowers, pay for dinners, cook for me, the list goes on. A word to me doesn't matter because he treats me well. I'm not saying we are perfect, we're probably worse than must when we get into huge fights but will always stick around for the other.\n\nDoes anyone have a similar relationship? I don't know what I can do to make him realise saying I love you or thinking you can't feel love towards someone isn't an issue for me?"}],"chosen":[{"from":"human","value":"SUBREDDIT: r\/relationships\nTITLE: Are some people just incapable of love?\nPOST: My SO (21) and I (20) have been together for over a year and 6 months.
