Stainless steel tub dishwashers don't generally use a heating element to dry.  The steel walls cool faster than ceramics, pots and glass and the water is naturally condensed on the walls and drained.    Because it has a lower heat conductivity the plastic loses heat faster than the walls of the tub and doesn't allow for the convection drying to happen.  Also don't buy a dishwasher that pops it's own door open when finished unless it's installed directly under stone.  It will ruin your cabinets.  Source: I sell this shit everyday"}],"rejected":[{"from":"human","value":"Explain like I'm five years old: Why is tupperware wet coming out of the dishwasher, when plates and glasses are all dry?"},{"from":"gpt","value":"Likely there is also an issue with surface tension and wetting of the material.    Ceramic and glass have similar wetting (i.e. the contacting angle is small) so they will tend to 1) have more surface area expose per unit mass so evaporate better, and 2) be more likely to bead and slip off the material due to less frictional area for the same unit mass.    Plastics have a larger wetting angle which means less surface area is exposed for evaporation and water will be less mobile on the surface."}],"subset":"explainlikeimfive_test","id":35458}

With two eyes it can triangulate to work out the distance of the object you're looking at.  If you only have one eye, but you're moving your head, it can do something similar (half a second ago we looked at the object from *this* angle, and now we're looking at it from a slightly different angle, and we can compare the two to get a good idea of distance)  If you only have one eye, and your head isn't moving, your brain can still try to guess based on other cues. Maybe you know how big the object is, and you can use that to get a good estimate of how far away it is, for example. Or it might use the way light falls on the object to provide some sort of estimate. You'll still have *some* depth perception, but it'll be less accurate."}],"subset":"explainlikeimfive_test","id":35459}

{"prompt":[{"from":"human","value":"A bakery near me \"glazes\" their danishes in something that keeps them crispy. Any ideas what it might be? There's a bakery near me that makes shockingly good and interesting danishes. They really shine in terms of textural contrast. They must use a really high protein bread flour because I've not found such distinct lamination elsewhere, and it's on the chewy end. They typically put some kind of custard or cheesecake in the center, and some fruit or marshmallow on top. But the most intriguing feature of these danishes is that they have some kind of glaze, which I think contributes to the crispiness on its own, but also must help preserve the natural crispiness of the dough, because they stay crispy for hours.  I've tried to replicate this glaze at home many many times but one constraining factor is I genuinely don't know what it is.

I tried painting some melted sugar on with a pastry brush but that was a mess -- the sugar hardened in the air on the way to the danish, so I doubt that's what they're doing.  I'd imagine something like a simple syrup would achieve the opposite effect. I doubt it's a jam glaze (it's shiny and sweet, but it's not fruity).
