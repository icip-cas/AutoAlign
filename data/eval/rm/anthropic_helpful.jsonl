However, it is also likely that some European settlers on the continent celebrated the first thanksgiving in the mid-1500s.  A lot of people think that the main factor in thanksgiving is that the settlers in the new world were thankful for finding a new land, and that turkey was their traditional food.  Another factor that has often been thought to be important is the Pilgrims\u2019 relationship with the Native Americans, and the feast may be one way of trying to show them respect.
