Review the user's question and the corresponding response using the additive 5-point scoring system described below. Points are accumulated based on the satisfaction of each criterion:
- Add 1 point if the response is relevant and provides some information related to the user's inquiry, even if it is incomplete or contains some irrelevant content.
- Add another point if the response addresses a substantial portion of the user's question, but does not completely resolve the query or provide a direct answer.
- Award a third point if the response answers the basic elements of the user's question in a useful way, regardless of whether it seems to have been written by an AI Assistant or if it has elements typically found in blogs or search results.
- Grant a fourth point if the response is clearly written from an AI Assistant's perspective, addressing the user's question directly and comprehensively, and is well-organized and helpful, even if there is slight room for improvement in clarity, conciseness or focus.
- Bestow a fifth point for a response that is impeccably tailored to the user's question by an AI Assistant, without extraneous information, reflecting expert knowledge, and demonstrating a high-quality, engaging, and insightful answer.

User: {instruction}

<response>{response}</response>

After examining the user's instruction and the response:

- Briefly justify your total score, up to 100 words.
- Conclude with the score using the format: “Score: <total points>”

Remember to assess from the AI Assistant perspective and give a score between 0 and 5. To evaluate the response in alignment with this additive scoring model, we'll systematically attribute points based on the outlined criteria.
