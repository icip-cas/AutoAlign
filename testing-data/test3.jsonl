{"content": "I’ve never seen Meatworks full before in the numerous times that I’ve passed by it. Was a bit skeptical about the food, but when I finally tried it out, I’m pleased to report that they do a pretty good steak! Service was also pretty decent, even though I’ve read several reviews that mention otherwise.\nThe steak that I ordered was the Hanging Tender $26 and it lived up to its name. Every bite was really flavourful yet tender. The only thing I didn’t like was the herb butter which I chose. I think if given the choice again, I would go for the Cabernet Sauvignon Mushroom sauce. Come to think of it, it should have been common sense to order that sauce, but I was kind of hoping that the butter would be special too. But given that the steak is so heavy already, you don’t really want more fats via the butter. On the whole, still one of the best steaks I’ve had for this price range.\nThe Partner had the Ribeye. He was looking for grassfed Ribeye, but the only grassfed option was for the Sirloin which he doesn’t like. still, it was a tasty Ribeye and I enjoyed stealing bits of it too. The steak fries were also very good, crispy just the way I like it.\nDefinitely going to come back again to Meatworks. But a huge grouse is that they don’t serve alcohol! Something along the lines of them wanting to be Halal, so the waitress said. To intensify the pain, they haven’t actually removed the alcohol page from the menu!You have to go to the supermarket on the same floor to get the wine if you need some, and corkage is charged at $20 per bottle. Steak really tastes loads better when you have a glass of wine in hand. And for some reason, I really was hankering for a glass after all that energy spent on shopping earlier. We plodded through without the wine, but certainly for the next round, I will buy a bottle or sneak one in!\nMeatWorks ION Orchard\n2 Orchard Turn #04-12\nSingapore 238801\nT +65 6634 0026\nF +65 6634 8901\nE talktous@meatworks.com.sg", "url": "http://365days2play.com/category/3-2-shopping-centres/orchard-ion-mall/", "timestamp": "20130518101238", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "segment": "1368696382261", "image_urls": []}
{"content": "Postcards from a Global Trekker: Cape Town, South Africa\nI had a belated birthday celebration this year, given that my 40th birthday fell on Thanksgiving Day, 2010. While my family did a wonderful job incorporating a mini-celebration for me amongst the usual Turkey Day festivities, I never really did acknowledge the day with very much fanfare. Then six months into my 40th year I found myself presented with the rare opportunity of mixing business with pleasure and a second chance at marking a milestone year with a monumental event. At the coaxing of a colleague and friend, I said yes to taking a trip to a place that (20 years in the making) has been on my dream list of places to see in the world. This October I traveled to Cape Town, South Africa for the 2011 World Congress of the World Federation for Mental Health and below are just a few snapshots of the wonderful experience I had both professionally and personally.\nEleven days in total, half for the congress and half for exploring, the trip was both nothing and everything I could have imagined and more. The conference renewed in me my passion for medicine and reminded me of the importance and complications involved in addressing mental health issues on the larger world public health scale.\nAnd my time spent exploring the city of Cape Town and meeting its people was absolutely thrilling. Cape Town is blessed with the most stunning natural geologic beauty but its greatest treasures, in my humble opinion, are found amongst its people, especially its artists. I hope you enjoy below a small glimpse of my attempts at capturing the many beautiful experiences I was lucky enough have during my unforgettable adventure in South Africa.\nReader Comments", "url": "http://3sistersvillage.com/blog/2011/11/9/postcards-from-a-global-trekker-cape-town-south-africa.html", "timestamp": "20130518104126", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "segment": "1368696382261", "image_urls": [["/universal/images/transparent.png", "Date Date"], ["http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_4_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320345570650", null], ["http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_6_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320341975155", null], ["http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_1_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320341756261", null], ["http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_2_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320340855787", null], ["http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_5_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320342382339", null], ["http://threesistersvillage.squarespace.com/storage/CTSA_collage_3_web-large.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1320342533160", null]]}

Part of their responsibility is to make all interactions positive, and includes aspects of the software, the copy-writing, the graphics, layout, flows, physical experiences. It’s a shame when one part of the experience is top notch and another is dreadful. Cohesion is important.\nUser experience spans multiple practices. Let’s take an example from architecture. If an architect were hired by a deep-pocketed client to create a great user experience, they wouldn’t stop at the structure in which people live. They would pay attention to the surrounding greenery, the arc of the driveway, the views of the property at each angle…maybe even the way guests are greeted and the table is set. All of these touch-points are important parts of the larger system…the house is merely one piece of the puzzle.\nWeb designers, traditionally secure in the role of page creators, now have a wider purview.

{"content": "After the historic Navy SEAL raid that took out Osama bin Laden in early May, officials from the U.S. government shared an extraordinary amount of information about the top secret operation, including the revelation that the whole thing had actually been captured on video by cameras mounted on the SEALs' helmets.\nSeveral top U.S. officials said the video -- which reportedly contains the moment the al Qaeda leader was killed -- would not be made public, but a new report is calling into question whether the footage exists at all.\nThe report, slated for publication this week by The New Yorker, says that no helmet-cams were involved in the operation. The New Yorker's report offers a detailed account of the raid, but admits that parts may be \"imprecise\" since it can only be recreated based on recollection.\nCBS News first reported the existence of the helmet-mounted cameras, and top U.S. officials confirmed to several news organizations, including ABC News, at the time that some of the SEALs had worn them. That information was based on initial reports received by officials in Washington, D.C.\nThe New Yorker article does not cite any specific sources for its information on the helmet-cams, but bases other account details on U.S. officials involved in the operation.\nSpokesmen for the Department of Defense and U.S. Special Operations Command declined to comment for this report about the existence of the helmet-mounted cameras.\n\"We have not released any information on that operation, nor will we,\" U.S. SOCOM public affairs officer Ken McGraw told ABC News.\nWhen a tense President Obama and national security team watched the operation unraveling from the White House's Situation Room -- a moment now immortalized in an iconic photograph -- it was reported they were not watching live feeds from any helmet-cams, but instead a feed from a drone buzzing thousands of feet above the SEALs' heads.", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/osama-bin-laden-raid-navy-seal-helmet-cams/story?id=14205401", "timestamp": "20130518102150", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "segment": "1368696382261", "image_urls": [["http://a.abcnews.com/images/GMA/abc_gma_brian_ross_110505_wg.jpg", "VIDEO: SEALs Use Stealth Helicopter"]]}
