The setting of the sun provided little relief from the heat.  Even with doors and windows open, it was perhaps one of the most uncomfortable nights spent on the road thus far.  Relief did arrive, however, when after midnight a front moved through and the temperature dropped dramatically.  When I got up the next morning it was a chilly 48 degrees!

The light makeup on her face brings out an innocent and pure beauty that is making male fans exclaim with admiration for the singer.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practice is the process of integrating best available evidence with clinical expertise and patient values to guide nursing practice. Implementation of evidence-based practice in nursing practice is a challenge. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of training on the use of evidence-based practice among nurses. METHODS: A pre-experimental design with one group pretest-posttest design was used in this study. Data were collected using the Evidence-Based Nursing Practice Questionnaire, and the questionnaire was re-administered to the same respondents 3 months after the training. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the use of evidence-based practice among nurses before and after the training (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The training was effective in improving nurses' use of evidence-based practice."}]}, {"index": 654, "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "1950s horror comics zine line, Boo!M™, edited by Stephen R.

Ryonet Acquires Riley Hopkins Screen Printing\nRiley Hopkins Plant Will Remain Open For Manufacturing\nJan 8, 2013 – by Counselor\nRyonet Corporation, a provider of silk screening equipment and supplies, has acquired Riley Hopkins Screen Printing Machinery LLC. Based in Gig Harbor, WA, Riley Hopkins has more than 35 years experience building manual screen printing presses. The company's plant in Gig Harbor will remain open for manufacturing. Parts and equipment will continue to be sold from that facility and Ryonet locations. Further details on the acquisition were not released.\nIn a statement, Riley and Val Hopkins, the former owners of the company, said it made sense to sell to Ryonet given the two businesses' strong partnership over the years. \"We have worked very well together during Ryonet's growth, and it is only logical to have them take over the reins,\" the Hopkins said, in a statement. \"They have an excellent customer service record, great warehousing facilities in a number of cities, and the ability to respond quickly to customer needs, not only from a machinery standpoint, but from a printing standpoint as well. All in all, Ryonet is best equipped to handle the move to the next level of excellence.\"\nBased in Vancouver, WA, Ryonet is focused on continuing to improve the Riley Hopkins line, with some \"very exciting things\" already in the works, said CEO Ryan Moor.

In 2011, AT&T sought to buy T-Mobile USA, the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier, in a $39 billion deal. The Justice Department sued to block the deal, arguing that it would reduce competition and lead to higher prices for consumers.\nA federal judge in 2012 ruled that the deal would reduce competition and lead to higher prices for consumers, and he ordered the companies to stop the deal.\nThe companies dropped their appeal of the judge’s ruling in 2016, and the deal was called off.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Tom Brown)"}]}, {"index": 956, "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "1.

Witnesses for the defense were prevented from testifying, cross examination was restricted according to U.S. and Jamaican attorneys who went to observe and consult with the defendants. The presiding justice admitted that the normal procedure with appeals to the Eastern Caribbean Judicial bench and thus a higher appeal to the Privy Council in London would be denied.\nIn a booklet brought back by attorneys entitled \"The Side You Haven't Heard; Bernard Coard Speaks to the Court in Grenada\" (August 1986) Coard presents documentation of the close comradely relations between Bishop and himself to the very end. Decisions of the Central Committee provided for separate responsibilities of the two leaders. At a Central Committee meeting just prior to the invasion and Bishop's house arrest, Bishop conceded that he had failed to implement the resolutions that were then adopted by the full Committee.\nGiven the history of infiltration, destabilisation, military force and cooptation, by the U.S. in the region and the stated policy of preventing \"another Cuban model\", a scenario of assasination by other members of the New Jewel Movement's leadership should be reexamined.\nSincerely,\nDavid Silver"}]}, {"index": 1313, "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "5401435566\n\nSOLUTION: This is not an efficient method.

As the world celebrates the 50th anniversary of these protests, it is important to reflect on the lessons learned from this turbulent time.\nIn the United States, the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the election of Richard Nixon as president sparked nationwide protests against the Vietnam War and racial discrimination. In France, students took to the streets to demand more autonomy from the state, while in Italy, workers went on strike to demand higher wages and better working conditions. In Czechoslovakia, Alexander Dubček’s “Prague Spring” reforms were met with a Soviet-led invasion, while in Mexico City, students occupied the University of Mexico to demand greater academic freedom.\nDespite the widespread unrest, many governments continued to cling to authoritarianism. In China, the Cultural Revolution led to mass violence and political persecution, while in Turkey, a military coup led to years of military rule. In Spain, the regime of Francisco Franco remained in power despite widespread opposition, while in South Africa, the apartheid regime continued to oppress the black majority.\nAs we look back on 1968, it is clear that while some progress was made in terms of civil rights and political freedoms, much work remains to be done. The legacy of 1968 continues to inspire people around the world to speak out against injustice and demand change, and it serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up for what you believe in, even in the face of adversity."}]}, {"index": 1354, "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "1.

Players take on the role of the young wizard Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, learns to cast spells, and fights off evil wizard Lord Voldemort.\nThe game features a single-player campaign with six different levels, each based on a different location within the Hogwarts school. Players must navigate their way through these environments, fighting off enemies and completing puzzles to progress through the game.\nOne of the unique features of HARRY POTTER is the ability to cast spells using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers. Players must hold the Wii Remote in one hand and the Nunchuk in the other, and then move the controllers in different directions to cast different spells. This adds an extra layer of control and immersion to the gameplay experience.\nAnother interesting aspect of HARRY POTTER is the ability to transform into different creatures, such as a werewolf or a giant snake. Players can use these transformations to access new areas of the game world or to take down enemies more effectively.\nOverall, HARRY POTTER is a fun and engaging game that offers a unique take on the popular book series. Its combination of action-packed gameplay, spell casting mechanics, and creative transformations make it a must-play for fans of the series and gamers alike."}]}, {"index": 1734, "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": " Please write a review of the book \"Educational Pessimism\" by J.
