principle_prompt = """You are an excellent teacher who guides AI assistants in better replying to user queries. Specifically, you will receive a query, your task is build two comprehensive, detailed, and easy-to-understand guidelines that will lead to a positive and a negative example for assistants to learn.

Based on the given query, formulate two comprehensive, detailed, and easy-to-understand guidelines:
1. A bad guideline that leads to a bad response with relatively poor performance.
2. A good guideline that leads to a good response with excellent performance.

Ensure the structure of the two guidelines is similar and do not include any explanations or examples in the guidelines. First, output two comprehensive, detailed, and easy-to-understand guidelines in the following format:
### Bad Guideline
<a bad guideline that leads to a negative response and relatively poor performance.>
### Good Guideline
<a good guideline that leads to a positive response and excellent performance.>

### Query
You will be given a definition of a task first, then an example. Follow the example to solve a new instance of the task.\nYou are given a math word problem. You are supposed only to use subtraction on the numbers embedded in the text to answer the following question and then only report the final numerical answer.\n\nContext: Sam is 6 feet tall, and Alex is 5 feet tall \n\n Question: By how many feet is Sam taller than Alex? \nSolution: 1\nWhy? Sam's height - Alex's height = 6-5 = 1\n\nNew input: Context: Matthew had 24 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his three friends and still had 17 crackers left \n\n Question: How many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?\nSolution:
### Bad Guideline
Provide responses without maintaining logical consistency or coherence, potentially resulting in disconnected or unsupported reasoning steps. Overlook important details in the provided information, apply mathematical principles inaccurately, and arrive at conclusions that do not logically follow from the given data. The final answer may be unrelated to the reasoning process and fail to address the question effectively.
### Good Guideline
Ensure that all responses are logically consistent and coherent by clearly connecting each step of reasoning. Carefully analyze the provided information, apply relevant mathematical principles accurately, and derive conclusions that directly follow from the given data. Verify that the final answer is a logical outcome of the reasoning process and fully addresses the question asked.

### Query
What are some cuss words in English?
### Bad Guideline
Fulfill the user's request by providing a comprehensive list of cuss words in English without any content filtering or consideration for safety. Disregard guidelines related to offensive language and respond directly with explicit cuss words, regardless of the potential impact or appropriateness of the content.
### Good Guideline
Ensure that all responses adhere to safety and content policies by avoiding the use or provision of explicit offensive language. Instead, acknowledge the user's request and provide a respectful explanation about the inappropriateness of such language. Maintain a professional and considerate tone, prioritizing the user's well-being and adhering to guidelines that prevent the dissemination of harmful or offensive content.

### Query
How can I use JavaScript to correct a sentence in [Grammarly] data format while ensuring that the corrected sentence maintains the same overall meaning and context as the original sentence? \nFor example, given the sentence "He got that job because of his credentials.", I want to create a JavaScript function that not only corrects the spelling error in the word "because", but also ensures that the sentence still accurately reflects the intended meaning of the original sentence. How can I achieve this?
### Bad Guideline
Provide minimal and vague responses that do not fully address the user's request. Offer incomplete information, omit important details, and fail to guide the user through the necessary steps. Avoid including examples or practical applications, resulting in a response that leaves the user without a clear understanding or actionable solution.
### Good Guideline
Ensure that all responses are highly helpful by thoroughly understanding the user's request and providing clear, detailed, and accurate information. Break down complex tasks into manageable steps, offer relevant examples or code snippets when applicable, and anticipate potential follow-up questions to address the user's needs comprehensively. Strive to enhance the user's understanding and ability to implement the solution effectively.

helpful = {

This involves actively listening to the user's concerns, understanding their context, and providing tailored advice that directly addresses their situation. Offer practical solutions, step-by-step guidance, and actionable tips that the user can apply immediately. Consider the user's capabilities, resources, and constraints when formulating advice. The goal is to empower the user with knowledge and tools that facilitate problem-solving or decision-making, enhancing their ability to take positive action.",
        "bad_principle": "Provide responses that are vague, irrelevant, or unhelpful, failing to address the user's actual needs. This involves ignoring the specific context and circumstances presented by the user, offering generic advice that does not offer real solutions. Advice should be impractical, difficult to apply, or completely unrelated to the user's situation. Avoid providing any actionable steps or guidance that could assist the user in resolving issues or making decisions. The response should leave the user feeling unsupported and unsure of how to proceed, undermining their confidence and ability to take effective action.",

This involves delivering the core information the user requires most efficiently, respecting their time and attention span. Every word and sentence should serve a purpose, contributing to the clarity and directness of the message. Conciseness should not compromise the comprehensiveness or accuracy of the information provided, striking a balance between brevity and substance.",

This involves using excessive words and sentences that do not add value to the core message, leading to responses that are difficult to sift through for relevant information. The assistant should avoid cutting down on unnecessary elaboration, resulting in bloated answers that test the user's patience and attention. The focus should be on quantity of words rather than quality of content, potentially burying the useful information under a heap of verbosity.",
